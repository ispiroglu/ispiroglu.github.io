## Summary

Mid-level backend developer with 3+ years of professional experience in distributed systems and high-load microservices. Primary stack: Go (Golang) and Kotlin/Java (JVM). I design event-driven services with Kafka, gRPC, CQRS, and CDC; apply idempotency, backpressure/circuit breaking, and robust observability (Grafana, OpenTelemetry). I operate mainly on on-prem Kubernetes with CI/CD; data stores include PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, and Couchbase. Motivated by high-load systems and impactful engineering; open to remote/hybrid and relocation.

## Experience

### Trendyol — Mid-level Software Engineer (promoted from Associate)
Nov 2023 — Present • Istanbul, Türkiye

- Architected multi-AZ, event-driven microservices with CQRS + CDC, sustaining ~1.4M req/min at ~100ms latency under complex ElasticSearch-backed queries.
- Developed an integrated Q&A architecture with an event-driven translation pipeline, processing ~300k questions into 5+ languages and enhancing global support.
- Built a RAG-based application to proactively address seller queries, achieving up to 3x increase in conversion rates.
- Co-initiated Chaki (open-source Golang framework) by implementing auto-configuration and observability modules, reducing boilerplate and streamlining microservice development.
- Owned technical design reviews, code review, and on-call incident response; set OKRs/scorecards and drove data-driven decisions via PoCs.

### Doğuş Technology — Software Engineer (promoted from Trainee to Junior)
Sep 2022 — Nov 2023 • Istanbul, Türkiye

- Designed and delivered a multi-tenant authentication API (Kotlin, Spring Boot) with token-based security, enabling centralized access control across tenants and improving scalability.
- Led metrics-driven PoCs for messaging, storage, and orchestration on an on-prem platform, informing core distributed system architecture choices.
- Implemented Kafka consumer backpressure and service-level circuit breaking, preventing overload and containing cascading failures during traffic spikes.
- Diagnosed production bottlenecks to improve median response time by ~20%, and established observability with Grafana + OpenTelemetry to reduce MTTR.
