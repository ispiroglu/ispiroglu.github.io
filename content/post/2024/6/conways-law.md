We, humans, have been communicating since we stared living together. Firstly, maybe we were just communicating with each other about where to hunt, where to find food etc... But we evolve over time, and the reason why we communicate is changed, we started to communicate for more complex reasons like find out how to live together, building relationships, expressing emotions, ***sharing knowledge*** and so on. 

With the latest technologies and needs, we started to work with high number of co-workers in our jobs. With a simple math, If there is 100x work to do, we may hire 100 people to do that job correctly. We may think this will fasten the process. But it's not like that. When you start to have more people in a team, communication becomes harder and harder. Even we are using all kind of tools for communication and have a great communication between us, the ending result of the job may not be the one we wanted. That's why **John Conway**, an American computer scientist, came up with the Conway's law. 
>  "Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." -- John Conway

So what is that even mean? Copy of a communication structure? How could it be?
Let's examine this concept with an example. Imagine there is two different teams in a department. Now let's say the first team has a very good communication between them, they know each other well, they have a clear understanding about what they need to do. And the second team also has a great communication structure among themselves and they have a clear understanding about what they need to do aswell. 

Now let's say that, there has to be a new project which requires both teams to work together. So we put them in one room and tell them "Hey guys, you are going to work on this project together". What happens? The first team starts talking about their own things, they start using their own language, they start thinking about how they can do it themselves. And the second team also does the same thing. They start talking about their own things, they start using their own language, they start thinking about how they can do it themselves. Even if they are in the same room, they won't be able to communicate effectively with each other.  Because they have different communication structures. The first team has a structure that is based on their own way of communicating and the second team also has its own structure. And when you put them together, it's like trying to merge two different systems.

So the project starts, both teams start to work and develop parts of the project. Every team will fill the needs of the project as they know. At the end, the result will have 2 main structures. It may be a good system but it won't be a single system. It will certanly be two systems that are connected together somehow because of there will be 2 different perspective to the project. 

As previosly mentioned, The system does not have to be bad, unusable system. But what if we wanted the system to consist of 4 modules? It is clear that we can't create 4 different modules with 2 different teams. Yes, we could do it on paper but the result will be no different than the current system. Instead of 2 big systems, we would have 4 small systems that connected with 2 pairs. That's where the ***Inverse Conway Maneuver***
